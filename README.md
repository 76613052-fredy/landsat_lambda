# landsat_lambda
This notebook is a simple demonstration of drilling a timeseres of NDVI values from the Landsat 8 scenes held on AWS using AWS Lambda functions called from PyWren.
It relies on the l8_ndvi_point function from the [remotepixel-api](https://github.com/RemotePixel/remotepixel-api) and [PyWren](https://github.com/pywren/pywren).
